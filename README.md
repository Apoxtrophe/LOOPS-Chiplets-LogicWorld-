# CHIPLETS
This mod reshapes all of the logic and connection components of Logic World into smaller, more space efficient, and more connect-able sizes and shapes. Every component that used to take up 2 or even 4 spaces, now takes only 1, all inputs and outputs have also been moved onto the top which allows for components to connect to eachother much more easily. 


# Install

Place the CHIPLETS folder directly into /Logic World/GameData folder alongside the MHG folder and any other mods you have installed.
