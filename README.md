# LOOPS' Chiplets
!Mod made for public preview version 0.91, 510! 

Put simply this mod reshapes nearly every logic component in Logic World to fit within a 1 width cube, this means smaller components that can all tile together perfectly in a grid!

This mod also moves the inputs and outputs of every component to the top, this makes it much, much easier to build complex circuitry because all of the outputs and inputs are on the same level.
